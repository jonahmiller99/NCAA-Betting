# NCAA-Betting


This project is looking at historical NCAA basketball data in an attempt to create a model to predict 
whether a team will cover a spread.

Eventually these probabilities will be used in building a betting framework based on the kelly criterion.  

Update:  Out of nowhere this repo got a lot of traffic. In an effort to not overload the site I am scraping data from I have decided to remove the script that 
I wrote to scrape.  Instead I have uploaded the pickles which are used in the cleanup file in order to show that the scraping and cleanup work.
